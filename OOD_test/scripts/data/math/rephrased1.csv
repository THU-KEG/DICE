Determine the number of vertical asymptotes present in the function \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\),"Begin by examining the denominator of the given function \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\). To find the roots, factorize the quadratic expression \(x^2+x-6\) which results in \((x-2)(x+3)\). Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, creating undefined points for the function. Setting each factor to zero, we get \(x = 2\) and \(x = -3\). Since the numerator does not provide any cancellations, both \(x = 2\) and \(x = -3\) result in vertical asymptotes. Consequently, the function has \(\boxed{2}\) vertical asymptotes."
Determine the result when the greater value between 120 percent of thirty and 130 percent of twenty is subtracted from the smaller value.,"First, let's calculate 120 percent of thirty. Since 10 percent of thirty is three, 120 percent then becomes twelve times three, which equals thirty-six. Next, for 130 percent of twenty: 10 percent of twenty is two, so 130 percent of twenty would be thirteen times two, giving us twenty-six. Now, the difference between these two results (thirty-six minus twenty-six) is ten. Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{10} \)."
What value of \( x \) fulfills the equation \( \lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7} \)? Present your answer as a simple fraction.,Let us determine \( x \) in such a way that it satisfies the given equation \( \lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7} \).

"Given that \(2^8\) is equal to \(4\) elevated to some power \(x\), how can we determine the value of \(x\)?","Start by recognizing that \(4\) can be expressed as a power of \(2\). Specifically, \(4\) is \(2^2\). Hence, \(4^x\) can be rewritten as \((2^2)^x\). Using the properties of exponents, \((2^2)^x\) becomes \(2^{2x}\). Now, we know that \(2^8\) must be equal to \(2^{2x}\). Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: \(8 = 2x\). Solving for \(x\) involves dividing both sides of the equation by \(2\), which gives \(x = 4\). Therefore, \(x\) is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Determine the 100th element in the arithmetic progression where the terms follow the pattern: 6, 10, 14, 18, ...","The given sequence is an arithmetic progression where the initial term \(a_1\) is 6. To find the interval between consecutive terms (common difference \(d\)), subtract the first term from the second term: \(d = 10 - 6 = 4\). The formula to uncover the \(n\)-th term in an arithmetic sequence is \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d\). Plugging in our values, for \(n = 100\), it becomes:
\[a_{100} = 6 + (100 - 1) \cdot 4\]
\[a_{100} = 6 + 99 \cdot 4\]
\[a_{100} = 6 + 396\]
\[a_{100} = 402.\]
Thus, the 100th term is \(\boxed{402}\)."

"Mr. Madoff puts $1000 into an investment fund that compounds at a fixed rate yearly. After 36 months, the value of his investment rises to $1225. What is the yearly interest rate as a percent, rounded to the nearest whole number?","Let’s denote the annual interest rate by \( r \). Mr. Madoff's investment equation after three years is \( 1000 \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^3 = 1225 \). Dividing both sides by 1000, we get \( \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^3 = 1.225 \). Taking the cube root of 1.225, we find \( 1 + \frac{r}{100} = \sqrt[3]{1.225} \approx 1.069987 \). Solving for \( r \), we find \( r \approx (1.069987 - 1) \times 100 = 6.9987 \).

"Identify the smallest value of $x$ that fits within the domain of the function given by
\[ g(x) = \sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \ . \]","To find the smallest value of $x$ where $g(x)$ is defined, we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative:
\[(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \geq 0.\]
First, expand both squares:

\[ x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 \geq 0 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 10x - 55 \geq 0 \]
Solving for $x$:
\[ 10x \geq 55 \]
\[ x \geq \frac{55}{10} \]
\[ x \geq \frac{11}{2} \]
Thus, the smallest $x$ for which $g(x)$ is defined is $\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$."
Consider the piecewise function defined by:,"Since \( -10 \) is less than \( -3 \), we must use the part of the function where \( f(x) = 3x + 5 \). Substituting \(-10\) for \(x\) in this equation:

"Three years ago, Mike purchased a postage stamp for $1.25. Recently, he received an offer that is twice the purchase price he originally paid. If the value of the stamp continues to double every three years, how much money will Mike be offered in 12 years' time?","Starting with the current value of the stamp at $2.50, we recognize that periods of doubling occur every three years. Over the next 12 years, there are four of these periods (12 / 3 = 4). Consequently, the value will double four additional times. This results in a factor of $2^4 = 16$, so the offered price in 12 years will be:

"A gas sample's pressure changes inversely with its volume while the temperature is kept constant. Suppose we have hydrogen gas confined in a container of 3.75 liters at a pressure of 4.2 kPa. If we transfer this gas into another container with a volume of 1.9 liters, maintaining the same temperature, what will be the pressure in the new container, expressed in kPa?","Since the pressure \(P\) and the volume \(V\) of the gas exhibit an inverse relationship, this can be expressed as \(P \times V = k\), where \(k\) is a constant. Initially, the gas has a volume of 3.75 liters and a pressure of 4.2 kPa, so \(k = 3.75 \times 4.2 = 15.75\). When the gas is moved to the 1.9 liter container, let the new pressure be \(P'\). Using the relation \(P' \times 1.9 = k\), we get \(P' \times 1.9 = 15.75\). Solving for \(P'\), we find \(P' = \frac{15.75}{1.9} = 8.29\) kPa, thus the new pressure is approximately \(\boxed{8.29}\) kPa."

Determine the value of $\log_{\sqrt{8}}(64\sqrt{8})$.,"Begin by setting $y = \log_{\sqrt{8}}(64\sqrt{8})$. This relationship implies that $\sqrt{8}^y = 64\sqrt{8}$.

Equating the exponents, we get $8^{y/2} = 2^{15/2}$. Since $8 = 2^3$, then $8^{y/2} = (2^3)^{y/2} = 2^{3y/2}$. Thus, $3y/2 = 15/2$, leading to $3y = 15$ and therefore $y = 5$.

Let \( n \) represent the number of widgets sold. The total cost equation includes the fixed cost and variable cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 1000 + 0.50n \]
The revenue from selling \( n \) widgets is:

Thus, the resulting polynomial from multiplying $p(t)$ with $q(t)$ will be of the 14th degree. Hence, the degree of the product is $14$."

Determine the cube root of the sum of four \(4^5\) terms.,"Begin by recognizing the expression inside the cube root:
