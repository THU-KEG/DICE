Determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the function given by \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).,"First, we need to identify the points at which the denominator of the function \( x^2 + x - 6 \) equals zero, since these points will lead to vertical asymptotes. Factoring the quadratic expression in the denominator, we get \( x^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3) \). Setting each factor to zero yields the equations \( x - 2 = 0 \) and \( x + 3 = 0 \), giving us \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -3 \). Because the numerator \( 2 \) is a constant and nonzero, vertical asymptotes occur at these x-values. Hence, there are \( \boxed{2} \) vertical asymptotes present in the graph of this function."
How much greater is 120% of 30 compared to 130% of 20?,"First, calculate what 120% of 30 is. To get this, multiply 30 by 1.2, which equals 36. Next, find 130% of 20 by multiplying 20 by 1.3, resulting in 26. Finally, subtract 26 from 36 to find the positive difference: 36 - 26 = 10. Therefore, the amount by which 120% of 30 exceeds 130% of 20 is 10."
Determine the value of \( x \) given the equation \( \lceil x \rceil + x = \frac{23}{7} \). Represent \( x \) in fractional form.,"Start by recognizing that if \( \lceil x \rceil + x = \frac{23}{7} \), \( x \) must be a positive number since the sum of a positive number and its ceiling cannot be negative. Identify the fractional component of \( x \) as \(\frac{2}{7}\)."
